# Create a blockchain with Javascript
The idea behind this is to learn more on how to create a Blockchain.

I am a hard reader and learn a lot on crypto-currencies by these days. As a developer I wanted to understand what is Blockchain and what problems it solves instead of reading bullshit. Reading is not enought, you have to code to master it.
Tell me if I'm wrong, I'm just trying to master it.
