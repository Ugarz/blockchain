# Create a blockchain with Javascript

The idea behind this is to learn more on how to create a Blockchain.

I am a hard reader and learn a lot on crypto-currencies by these days. As a developer I wanted to understand what is Blockchain and what problems it solves instead of reading bullshit. Reading is not enought, you have to code to grasp it.

# Scripts

```bash
npm run build && npm start #launch the dist/index.js script
npm run dev #launch the devmod with nodemon
```
