# Create a blockchain with Javascript
The idea behind this is to learn more on how to create a Blockchain.

I am a hard reader and learn a lot on crypto-currencies by these days. As a developer I wanted to understand what is Blockchain and what problems it solves instead of reading bullshit. Reading is not enought, you have to code to master it.
Tell me if I'm wrong, I'm just trying to master it.

# Scripts
```bash
npm start #launch the index.js script
npm run dev #launch the devmod with nodemon
npm run build:doc #(Re)build the html documentation
npm run serve:doc #Serve the html documentation
npm run doc #Build and serve the html documentation over http://localhost:5000
```
